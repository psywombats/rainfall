The project is apparently dead so this source is public.

Most of it is outdated, and further version of this engine converted to a more turn-based format. I'm still actively developing a fork of this thing (and been using it for some other games) but this repo should serve as public record of where development was when the game was cancelled.

Thanks for your support, feel free to contact me with questions (doubt Karim will get back to you)
